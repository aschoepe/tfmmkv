I have ported the C code "mkversion.c" from Richard Hipp into Tcl "mkversion.tcl".
This allows a "manifest.txt" to be created from the two files "manifest" and "manifest.uuid" generated by Fossil.
As shown in the example, this can be read into tcl packages and used for a procedure build-info TIP-599.

There is an example code for a tcl package "example.tcl".
Here I make use of the fact that after the "package provide" I use the "info script" to remember the directory path
at the time when the package is loaded in order to reload "manifest.txt" later from the same directory.
